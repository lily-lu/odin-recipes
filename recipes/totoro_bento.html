                <p>Among one of the most iconic Studio Ghibli films, <em><strong>My Neighbor Totoro</strong></em> is a heartwarming tale of innocence and youth. One scene shows Satsuki making Mei, her younger sister, a <em>bento</em> which is a Japanese boxed lunch.The bento is strongly rooted in Japanese cuisine and consists of a variety of ingredients such as fish, meat, pickles, and vegetables. Bento boxes can be filled with anything but the main ingredient is frequently rice.</p>

            <div class="lists">
                <ol>
                    <li>Put cooked rice in your bento box about 3/4 of the way full (leave some room at the top for your toppings and to be able to put the lid on).</li>
                    <li>Put the pickled Japanese plum on one side of  the rice.</li>
                    <li>In a small pan, heat the oil on medium-high. Cook one shishamo on both sides until cooked.</li>
                    <li>Place the cooked shishamo across the middle of the bento box on the rice.</li>
                    <li>Boil water in a small pot. Put in a handful of frozen edamame and cook according to package instructions.</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, pop the edamame beans out of the pod. Arrange them on the rice to fill up a little less than one quarter of the bento box, under the shishamo.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the sakura denbu on the rice next to the edamame.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy whenever it's lunch time! Put a lid on it and pack it away to take with you.</li>
                </ol>
