        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>From the Studio Ghibli film <em><strong>Spirited Away</strong></em>, Chihiro's friend, Haku, gives her a Japanese rice ball known as <em>onigiri</em>. Onigiri is one of the most popular foods in Japan and is typical Japanese soul food. It is commonly triangular shaped and is wrapped in dried seaweed called <em>nori</em>. A variety of fillings exist where the most common include tuna mayo, salmon, and pickled plum.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ⅔ cups cooked Japanese rice</li>
                <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 tsp sesame seeds (black or normal works)</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>1 sheet of nori</li>
                <li>1 can of tuna</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Japanese mayo</li>
            </ul>


        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix your rice, sesame oil, salt and sesame seeds until well combined.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix your canned tuna and mayo together.</li>
                <li>Cut your sheet of nori vertically first. Then cut the pieces horizontally to create small strips to wrap around the base of your onigiri.</li>
                <li>With wet hands (this is important) or a sheet of cling film, grab ⅓ cup of cooked rice. Roll it into a ball. Flatten it. If you're using cling film, place the rice into the middle of the cling film.</li>
                <li>Place 1 tsp of tuna mixture into the center of the rice. Push the tuna mixture into the rice ball with your thumbs. This prevents the tuna from seeping out.</li>
                <li>Then seal the tuna with your rice shaping it back into a ball with the help of wet hands or your cling film.</li>
                <li>Then shape it into a triangle using the flat surface of your board or your fingers.</li>
                <li>Place your nori strip on a clean plate, then place your triangle overtop in the middle and wrap the edges upwards to stick to the rice. Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
